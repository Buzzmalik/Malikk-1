                            <div class="space">                          <p >For her whole life, my grandmother has relied on cocoa farming as her primary source of income. 
                                Her farm, located near an industrial area, used to flourish with healthy cocoa trees, providing
                                 a bountiful harvest year after year. Then a nearby factory started emitting toxic pollutants into
                                  the air and water. The cocoa plants on my grandmother's farm began to wither. Their once-vibrant 
                                  green leaves and rich healthy pods started to droop, their leaves turning yellow and brittle.</p>


                                  <p>Pollution has become a silent antagonist to farmers like my grandmother in the otherwise lush 
                                    cocoa-growing regions of Ghana. Industrial activities and agricultural practices release pollutants 
                                    into the air and water <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/19/10945">(Wainaina et al., 2021).</a> Emissions from factories and vehicles settle on cocoa 
                                    leaves, causing the leaves to curl; as they discolor—turning yellow, brown, or even black—they become
                                     unable to carry out photosynthesis and absorb nutrients. The consequences are evident: cocoa trees 
                                     suffer from reduced growth and lower crop yields. Moreover, improper waste disposal and pesticides
                                      contaminate water sources, affecting both cocoa tree health and the quality of the cocoa beans.</p>


                                      <p>Farmers continuously suffer from the devastation of pollution in their daily lives. Cocoa farming 
                                        had been my grandmother’s sole means of sustenance, so the sudden loss of a harvest left her struggling
                                         to make ends meet. She and her workers had to make difficult choices, such as cutting back on essential
                                          expenses like medical care and sacrificing their children's education. The pollution also posed 
                                          severe health risks to our family. The polluted air caused respiratory problems, such as coughing
                                           fits and difficulty breathing. Skin irritation and allergies became commonplace, and the overall
                                            well-being of my grandmother and her neighbors deteriorated. She now lives in constant fear of 
                                            long-term health complications caused by exposure to the factory's toxic emissions.
                                    </p>


                                    <p>Stories like my grandmother’s are common: pollution endangers many local farmers’ livelihood and health, 
                                        as well as the overall economy <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519621002011">(Fisher et al., 2021).</a> It can make people sick with things like coughs, 
                                        diarrhea, and even cancer. Polluted air and water can increase asthma and heart problems, especially 
                                        among the young, old, or those who are already sick. These problems leave patients with medical bills 
                                        they cannot afford because of pollution’s equally negative impact on the economy. Disease makes it harder
                                         for people to work well, and pollution hurts tourism, which can make locals lose more jobs and money. 
                                    </p>


                                    <p>Pollution from factories and improper waste disposal harms the health of both cocoa trees and their
                                         farmers, and it diminishes the local economy. Though no one wants to inhibit innovation, communities
                                          must pay more attention to its environmental impacts. To understand, manage, and mitigate the risks 
                                          of pollution, we must consider where and how pollution is released, where it goes, how it affects 
                                          the health of humans, plants, and animals.
