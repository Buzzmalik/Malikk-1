                        <p>When he was nine, Frimpong started helping on his family’s cocoa farm by clearing weeds, planting
                            cocoa beans, and carrying harvested cocoa to the place where it would be dried. He took over the
                            farm when he was eighteen, dedicating his entire life to cultivating cocoa on his ancestral land
                            in Oblogo, just like his parents and grandparents before him. However, as the years went by,
                            Frimpong’s cocoa farming became less profitable as weather patterns changed, trees aged, and
                            markets fluctuated. Struggling to support his growing family, Frimpong found himself at a
                            crossroads. When illegal miners looking for gold and other precious minerals offered to buy his
                            land, Frimpong had to choose between the land and his family's needs.<p>


                            <p>Artisanal mining poses grave risks to cocoa farming. The mining process uses chemicals such as
                            mercury and cyanide that contaminate the soil, water, and surrounding areas. The toxic
                            substances harm cocoa tree health and compromise the quality of the beans. Illegal mining
                            activities also endanger the availability of clean and safe drinking water, which is crucial for
                            human health and the well-being of the environment <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227621001800">(Obiri-Yeboah et al., 2021)</a>.</p>

    
                            <p>Mining especially harms the environment by stripping the land bare. Deforestation results in
                            soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and disrupted ecosystems. The loss of trees also has a
                            profound impact on the local climate. The absence of a forest canopy leads to increased exposure
                            to the sun, resulting in higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. This shift in weather
                            patterns further exacerbates the challenges faced by the remaining cocoa farmers, making it even
                            more difficult for them to sustain their livelihoods <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718318779?casa_token=cKDCJ0adSQQAAAAA:5pBAt_PoGydV_BJc_kzbz73YzcmNiKUlTUQ4Glo3YLR6MvqwnEULi5LEYgxxhwUjI3i2f1MmyXo">(Negret et al., 2019).</a><p>


                            <p>Struggling farmers are aware of the long-term consequences of illegal mining, but many, like
                            Frimpong, still sell their land <a href="https://air.ashesi.edu.gh/handle/20.500.11988/386">(Laari, 2018).</a> They are ultimately enticed by the promise of
                            quick wealth, which can provide their children with an education and improve their families’
                            living conditions. Still, the effects of their decisions ripple through the entire community. As
                            Frimpong’s neighboring cocoa farmers depended on the surrounding forests for shade and
                            protection against extreme weather conditions, they too experienced reduced yields and
                            struggling crops, which forced them to sell their lands as well.</p>


                            <p>Frimpong's experience as a cocoa farmer shows the tough problems that many people in the
                                industry face. Illegal mining hurts farming and the environment with harmful chemicals and
                                deforestation, both of which disturb the area’s natural balance. Farmers have to make tough
                                choices to take care of their families, but their actions also affect other farmers nearby and
                                make it harder for cocoa production to keep going in a sustainable way.</p>
