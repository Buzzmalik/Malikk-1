                <p>Malik Mustapha, a recognized cocoa farmer and an influential youth leader in his community, 
                    combines his passion for research, community building, and technology to solve problems and 
                    assist those around him. He is fascinated by the complexities of infectious diseases and the 
                    repercussions of its effects due to environmental causes. In the future, he aims to utilize 
                    these skill sets in pursuing a career in global health to provide adequate and quality healthcare 
                    to the Ghanaian people. Motivated by his past experiences, he envisions an equitable future by 
                    improving healthcare access using Artificial Intelligence, and tackling environmental issues in West Africa. 
                    After graduating from Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School, Malik dedicated gap years to volunteering/internships, 
                    conducting research, taking online courses, and nurturing his siblings, preparing him for college and life's 
                    demands. In his free time, he enjoys learning, writing lines of code, caring for his rabbits, and 
                    immersing in classical music. As a Ghanaian, he also hopes to explore racial and continental 
                    disparities in assessing and affording health care.

                            <P>I am inspired by the efforts of organizations like the Dinker Agriculture Producer 
                                Company Limited (DAPCL) in Tapukara-Rajasthan, which works towards ending poverty 
                                through sustainable farm productivity and value chain development. The work of 
                                DAPCL interests me because I come from a farming background where the majority of the 
                                farmers live in poverty. Hence, I aim to improve the agri-sector in Ghana to help

                            <P>The impactful initiatives of Sightsavers in addressing the devastating effects of a parasitic

                                 prevention on a global scale. With people of my community having to deal with activities of
                                  pollution from factories and improper waste disposal, harming the health of both cocoa trees
                                   and the farmers, I intend to provide them with accessible and quality healthcare delivery
                                    to keep them healthy and enable them work effectively.
