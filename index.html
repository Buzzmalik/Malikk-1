            <div class="about_text">
                <p>Malik Mustapha, a cocoa farmer and recognized youth leader in his community, combines his passion for research,
                     community building, and technology to solve problems and assist those around him. He is particularly 
                     fascinated by the complexities of infectious diseases, especially those caused by environmental factors.
                    After graduating from Presbyterian Boys’ Secondary School, Malik dedicated gap years to volunteering, 
                    doing internships, conducting research, taking online courses, and nurturing his siblings, all of 
                    which have prepared him for the demands of college and life afterward. In his free time, he enjoys 
                    networking with people of his community, doing Wordles, writing code, caring for his rabbits, and 
                    immersing himself in classical music.
                    Seeing the prevalence of environmentally triggered illnesses in his home country of Ghana, Malik has 
                    educated the public about the causes and prevention of infectious diseases like malaria, diarrhea, and 
                    pneumonia. Malik hopes to pursue a career in global health to increase the availability and quality 
                    of healthcare in Ghana. He is especially excited by the possibility of using Artificial Intelligence, to reduce racial, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities in health care’s access and affordability.

                                through sustainable farm productivity and value chain development. The work of 
                                DAPCL interests me because I come from a farming background where the majority of the 
                                farmers live in poverty. Hence, I aim to improve the agri-sector in Ghana to help

                                 prevention on a global scale. With people of my community having to deal with activities of
                                  pollution from factories and improper waste disposal, harming the health of both cocoa trees
                                   and the farmers, I intend to provide them with accessible and quality healthcare delivery
                                    to keep them healthy and enable them work effectively.
