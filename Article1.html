                <p>Growing up on my grandmother's farm, there were always chores to do. Hers was a cocoa farm, and the cocoa had to be irrigated at least once a week. They also had to be harvested when ripe and dried under the sun for the  fermentation process, this is to assume its brown bean color for chocolate production and the pods converted to black soap. My grandmother used to work on the farm with three other laborers until I joined to help out. It started with me following her to the farm to play when I was a child, until I started to take on responsibilities such as clearing of weeds to get the farm into shape, designing the sickle used in harvesting the cocoa, and breaking the cocoa pods into two halves to separate the beans from the pod. 
                    Previously, young people learnt more complex skills and worked autonomously on a plot of family land contributing to their family's cocoa production in turn for small payments, but due to the rapid effects of climate change and environmental factors such as pollution, flooding, illegal mining, and farm expansion among farmers, these young people and farmers have quit farm works since it is no longer lucrative (Agyei-Manu et al., 2020).
                    
                    
                    In the lush cocoa-growing regions of Ghana, pollution emerges as a silent antagonist. Industrial activities and agricultural practices release pollutants into the air and water (Wainaina et al., 2021). Emissions from factories and vehicles settle on cocoa leaves, impairing their ability to carry out photosynthesis and absorb nutrients. The consequences are evident: cocoa trees suffer from reduced growth and lower crop yields. Moreover, improper waste disposal and pesticide use contaminate water sources, affecting both cocoa tree health and the quality of the cocoa beans.
                    
                    As the rainy season arrives, cocoa farmers brace themselves for another challenge- flooding. With increasing deforestation and the increasing impacts of climate change, around my home village, the impact of these climate related floods are becoming increasingly severe . Excessive rainfall and inadequate drainage systems waterlog the soil, depriving cocoa trees of essential oxygen and leading to root rot. Floods wash away the fertile topsoil, necessary for nutrient retention and healthy cocoa plant growth. Furthermore, pollination is disrupted, pests and diseases spread more easily, and cocoa pods are destroyed, resulting in diminished cocoa yields.
                    
                    Especially if they have been impoverished by environmental disasters like floods, farmers sell their lands to engage in illegal mining activities that provide them with a livelihood (Laari, 2018).  A typical example of such incident happened in the Ashanti region of Ghana when Mr Frimpong, a dedicated cocoa farmer whom all he has ever known was cocoa farming, was forced to sell his cocoa farm because of the uncompetitive prices of the cocoa farm at the international market, pollution of water bodies from chemicals used in illegal mining activities, and destruction of the land by miners.
                    Artisanal mining, focused on extracting minerals like gold, poses grave risks to cocoa farming. Chemicals such as mercury and cyanide, used in the mining process, contaminate the soil, water bodies, and surrounding areas. With cocoa farms situated near illegal mining sites, the toxic substances infiltrate the ecosystem, further harming cocoa tree health and compromising the quality of cocoa beans.
                    
                    The destruction of farms by illegal mining activities has caused increased tension, for cocoa farmers to meet the demand for land, while their own production is slowly squeezed out. Globally, in the last 15 years, there has been a continual increase in the demand for cocoa beans and its bi-products such as chocolate and cocoa butter. This increase in demand for cocoa supports the need to increase production and the value of the crop to local economies, and the intensification of research in this area (Suh and Molua, 2022). 
                    
                    The tale of cocoa farming in Ghana reveals the interplay between environmental factors and the sustainability of this vital agricultural industry. Pollution, flooding, illegal mining, and farm expansion all contribute to the challenges faced by cocoa farmers. To secure the future of cocoa farming, it is imperative to adopt sustainable agricultural practices, implement effective land-use planning, and enforce environmental regulations. By doing so, Ghana can protect its cocoa farms, preserve its natural resources, and ensure the continued success of its cocoa industry for generations to come.
